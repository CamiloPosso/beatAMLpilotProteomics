This file shows how we can use the `amlresistancenetworks` package alongside [Synapse](http://synapse.org) to pull down data and format it into easy-to-use synapse tables. 


First load the `amlresistancenetworks` package. This will get the synapse setup so that we can continue to process the data
```{r}
library(amlresistancenetworks)

```


## Get files from Synase
Original files are stored on synapse


## Store to data table

## Put in expression set?
considering adding this
